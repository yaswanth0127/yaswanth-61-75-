            Value Chains, Supply<br>
            Chains And Strategic<br>
            Alliances Issues<br></h1>

        <center><h2>Introduction</h2></center>
        <hr>
        <p>In the competitive scenario unfolding at the beginning of the 21st century,<br>
            characterized by the fast pace of technologic changes and opening and<br>
            volatilization of global markets, an understanding of global value chains is of
            critical importance to outlining strategy.<br>
        </p>
           <p>As shown in Chapter II, in the most complex production chains, assessing
            bargaining power in relation to customers and suppliers may not be enough to
            understand the power relationships in the global competitive market. Imagine
            a semiconductors industry, whose clients may be the PC industry, but also be
            in telecommunications, electronics end users, and new areas such as <i>smart
            cards.</i> How can one discuss bargaining power based only on the elements
            introduced on Chapter II?
        </p>
        <p>On the other hand, the process of decentralizing production activities, very
            often marked by globally-based outsourcing and by the streamlining of
            yesterday’s large corporate structures, created the so-called “network-companies.” According to Chesnais (1996), large companies operating on a global
            basis gave priority to some functions considered strategic, leading a global
            chain of suppliers and distributors, performing activities previously performed
            by verticalized companies.
        </p>
        <p>This process of “de-verticalization” presents some risks. However, when a
            company takes over value activities, it is possible to enforce its interests over
            other chain links by using its economic power.
        </p>
        <p>For small companies, which are part of these large chains, the understanding of
            power dynamics and relations is decisive for their survival and development,
            and to outline defensive strategies enabling them to increase their relative power
            in the chain by means of partnerships and networks of cooperation.
        </p>
        <p>The issues discussed are vital for strategy definition, since they bring a more
            detailed understanding of the game rules of the global value chains and of how
            to take advantage of its configuration, using networks and partnerships, or
            making use of location.
        </p>
        <p>This chapter intends to present a more in-depth discussion of the supply chain,
            introducing issues such as location, networks of cooperation, and the study of
            governance, both of local and global scope. The concept of value chains, both
            in product-based and in service-based industries, are addressed.
        </p>
        <center><h2>How to Define the Term Chains</h2>
            </center>
        <hr>
        <p>You are certainly familiar with the concepts of value chain, supply chain and
            global value chains. Are these expressions synonymous or is there a difference
            in concept among them?
        </p>
        <p>The first source of confusion is the fact that different research areas study the
            same phenomenon: the connection of several linkages in a chain, deployed in
            several tiers, from input to selling in global markets. These academic approaches are from the areas of strategy, logistics and operations, in addition to
            the economists, geographers, and social scientists.
        </p>
        <p>Although there are several similarities between these approaches, each area
            emphasizes different features of this phenomenon, as presented in the following
            sections.
        </p>
        <h2>The Value Chain</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>For Porter and Millar (1985, p. 3), the value chain “is system of interdependent
            activities, which are connected by linkages,” and could be divided in technologically and economically distinct activities that a company uses to do
            business, which affect cost or efficiency of other activities. Each of these
            activities would be a value activity.
        </p>
        <p>Nine generic activities have been identified by these authors, and classified in
            two groups: support activities and primary activities, as shown in Figure 3.1.
            The four support activities are: firm infrastructure, human resources management, technology development, and procurement. The five primary activities
            are: inbound logistics, operations, outbound logistics, marketing and sales, and
            services. To be performed, each one of these activities requires a physical and
            a data processing component, which is the reason why information technology
            (IT) has such a large impact on the value chain, as shown on Chapter VII.</p>
            <p>
            The <i>value system </i>concept is an enlargement of the value chain concept,
            contemplating an industry’s value chains from suppliers to end-consumers.
            Figure 3.2 shows the connections between activities within this value system.
        </p>
        <i>Figure 3.1. The value chain (adapted from Porter & Millar, 1985)</i>
    <center><img  src="C:\Users\user\Documents\Lightshot\Screenshot_31.png"></center>
        <i>Figure 3.2. The value system (adapted from Porter & Millar, 1985)</i>
    <center><img  src="C:\Users\user\Documents\Lightshot\Screenshot_32.png"></center>

        
        <p>It should be stressed that the value chain concept coined by Porter and Millar
            (1985) is contained within the firm bonders, and that the<i> value system</i> concept
            is the one bearing more similarity to the themes discussed in the next section,
            that is, supply chains and global value chains.
        </p>
        <p>
            Duhan et al. (2001), however, argue that in knowledge-based companies there
are difficulties in using value-chain analysis, as shown in Table 3.1. In this kind
of company, the value chain is less evident, due to the process’s interactive
nature, making it difficult to discriminate the added value of a single step. On
the other hand, in knowledge-based companies, human resources are essential
in achieving competitive advantage, which requires competence to extract
individual knowledge from experts through collaboration, managing a relevant
amount of informality.

        </p>
        <p>Quinn et al. (1990) also emphasize the knowledge assets in companies,
            especially in so-called intelligent enterprises, such as biotechnology, semiconductor and electronics industry. In these industries, these authors identify a
            loosely structured network around specialized core competencies, with a
            service-based strategy.
        </p>
        <i>Table 3.1. Value chain analysis applied to knowledge-based companies</i>
    <center><img  src="C:\Users\user\Documents\Lightshot\Screenshot_33.png"></center>
        <i>Figure 3.3. The service-profit chain (adapted from Schlesinger & Heskett,
            1991)
        </i>
    <center><img  src="C:\Users\user\Documents\Lightshot\Screenshot_34.png"></center>
        <p>Schlesinger and Heskett (1991) also argue that human resources are a critical
            resource in service activities and propose a service-profit chain, as shown in
            Figure 3.3. These authors argue that if the company just has employee
            satisfaction and retention it could be possible to achieve customer satisfaction
            and retention and, in consequence, a competitive advantage. A similar idea was
            proposed by Rucci et al. (1994) that highlights employee importance in the
            service value chain, so-called employee-customer profit chain.
        </p>
        <P>Heskett et al. (1994) also propose a service-profit chain audit, which allows
            making a diagnosis through 25 questions classified in the following categories:
            <i>profit and growth, customer satisfaction, external service value, employee productivity, employee satisfaction, employee loyalty, internal
            service quality, leadership, and relating the measures.</i>
        </P>
        <h3>Supply Chain</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Several researchers, especially in the logistics area, use the expression supply
            chain. According to Bowersox and Closs (2001), supply-chain management is
            the integration of the company’s essential business processes, from raw
            materials to end-users.
        </p>
        <p>Although this definition bears some similarity to the value system, in this case
            there is no concern with differentiating between support and primary activities,
            emphasizing the same primary activities, i.e., logistics.
        </p>
        <p>With the increase of outsourcing, logistic alliances took on a more relevant role
            in the formulation of corporate strategies. According to Bowersox (1990), the
            concept of logistic alliances characterized by cooperation, often based on
            informal agreements, forms a business pact where each part seeks the benefits
            of synergy brought on by joint work. Logistic partnerships are distinguished
            from other business cooperation models by the very strong connection between
            the participants, who, in practice, create an extended organization with its own
            role, rules, values, and goals.
        </p>
        <p>The most common forms of logistic alliance involve a <i>producer and a service
            supplier, </i>such as storage or transport company, and it can also combine
            service suppliers’ resources.
        </p>
        <p>
            Other common forms of logistic alliance are <i>vertical alignment between two
or more producers, </i>and <i>horizontal alignment.</i> The former is usually marked
by inventory transfer and the latter sells to the same customer base. Both may
include a service provider.
        </p>
        <p>For researchers in the operations-management area, the emphasis is on supplychain management, originating from the study of customer-suppliers cooperation networks typical of Japanese companies, know as <i>keiretsu,</i> which display
            very distinctive collaboration and partnership patterns. An example of these
            networks is the one headed by Japanese assemblers that guides suppliers, not
            only of the first tier, but also of the other tiers, transferring technology so as to
            avoid loss and lack of efficiency, so that the added value can be transferred to
            consumers. In this context, the concept is very similar to the <i>value system</i>
            concept presented in the section above.
        </p>
        <p>The main issues referring to <i>supply-chain management, </i>in this scope, have
            been discussed in Chapter II.
        </p>
        <h3>Global Value Chains
        </h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Finally, according to Gereffi (1994), the expression global value chains, found
            throughout the literature in several areas, can be characterized by the production and marketing of goods involving strategic decisions and the forming of
            international networks.<br></p>
            <p>
            For Gereffi (1994), there are two basic shapes of global value chains:
        <i>producer-driven chains</i> and <i>buyer-driven chains.</i><br></p>
            <p>
            In <i>producer-driven chains,</i> the key assets are productive, enabling large
            manufacturers to coordinate inter-organizational networks, making intensive
            use of capital and technology, such as those of the automobile and airplane
            industries.<br></p>
            <p>
            As for <i>buyer-driven chains,</i> the key assets are commercial, such as brand
            names, or marketing channels. The coordinators of the chain are the large
            retailers, designers and trading networks, which control how, when, and where
            the production will take place and what profit share should be attained at each
            step of the chain, though they have no productive devices. These chains usually
            involve third-world suppliers, such as shoes and toys (Gereffi, 1999). The main
            differences between these chains are summarized in Table 3.2.<br></p>
            <p>
            In more recent papers, Gereffi (2001) introduces a new chain configuration
            called the internet-oriented chain, i.e., production chains driven by the Internet.
            This configuration is detailed in Chapter X.<br></p>
            <p>
            Although the production chain description bears similarities to the previous
            definitions, here there is more stress on four dimensions, namely:
        </p>
        <i>Table 3.2. Governance structures in global value chains (adapted from
            Gereffi, 2001, p.34)
        </i>
    <center><img  src="C:\Users\user\Documents\Lightshot\Screenshot_35.png"></center>
        <p>1. A value chain of goods, services and resources in one or more industrial
            sector. In this context, it should be stressed that the meaning of <i>value
            chain</i> in Gereffi (2001) is different from the nomenclature proposed by
            Porter and Millar (1985), in which<i> global value chain</i> means <i>value
            system.</i>
        </p>
        <p>2. Geographic dispersion of chains on the regional, national, and global
            levels.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. Governance structure along the global value chain (value system), “which
refers to the key-actors in the chain that determine the inter-firm division
of labor, and shape the capacities of participants to upgrade their
activities.” (Gereffi, 2001, p. 30)

        </p>
        <p>4. Institutional framework.</p>
        <p>Other authors, such as Storper and Harrison, (1991) use the<i> production
            system</i> concept, which has some similarities to the<i> value system</i> concept, and
            is defined as the coordination structure of the chain, with vertical and horizontal
            relations among companies, that can be governed by market mechanisms or
            relations between the links.
        </p>
        <p>
            These authors emphasize, as a relevant dimension, besides the governance
structure and productions system features, the existence of clusters of companies. Storper and Harrison, (1991) stress the importance of local issues,
especially cluster environment, in the competitive environmental analysis.
Thus, in order to have a better understanding of the competitive environment,
the issues of location and clusters of companies are essential to make a good
map of the competitive environment and will be detailed below.
        </p>
        <center><h3>Location: The Role of Clusters
            in Competitiveness</h3></center><hr>
        <p>Studies of clusters or local production systems, among other names, originated
            from several areas, such as economic geography, regional development,
            competitive strategy studies, and technology development and innovation.
            </p>
            <p>A cluster can be defined as a geographic or sector concentration of companies,
                originating from external economies (externalities) and joint collaborative
                actions, enabling collective efficiency gains and entrance to global markets,
                which individual companies would not attain.
            </p>
            <p>Incidental external economies involve qualified labor, specialized suppliers of
                goods and services, and the overflow of knowledge and technology.
            </p>  
            <p>Joint actions, achieved by deliberate and conscious effort, can be divided into
                two kinds: cooperation between companies (e.g., sharing equipment) and
                groups of companies organized into associations or consortia, as for exportation. These joint cooperation actions can be horizontal (among competitors) or
                vertical (among chain tiers).
            </p>  
            <p>Thus, the emphasis lies not only on the incidental aspects resulting from
                externalities and historical aspects, but also on those related to forming a
                network relationship between companies and other institutions important for
                competition, capable of generating joint actions.
            </p>
            <p>The forming of clusters has an impact on productivity and scale, on innovation
                and new business. In this sense, companies entering a cluster and getting
                benefits from concentration and specialization have a competitive advantage.
                These benefits usually enable the locality to compete in the global market by
                entering production chains.
            </p>
            <p>Being in a cluster enables a company easy access to qualified manpower,
                minimizing expenses for training, and appropriating knowledge and technology
                by the overflow effect. Information and knowledge transmission flow either bya formal or informal learning process. Highlighted, however, is the role of
                cooperative joint actions which allow risk reduction, increase of increase and
                resources sharing, as stated above.
            </p>
            <p>The negative points could be blocking effects and asymmetries. Blocking
                effects, due to the excess of external economies, tend to dissuade the
                concentration of companies, generating, for instance, high transport and rental
                costs, canceling out part of the mentioned advantages. Asymmetries appear
                when the leading companies have a strong influence over the strategy of other
                cluster companies and inhibit joint cooperation actions.
            </p>
            <p>In summary, three aspects contribute to the analysis of local concentration:
            <i>competitive market, cluster collaborative environment, </i>and <i>cluster collective competencies</i> as shown in Figure 3.4.
            </p>
            <p>The kind of governance structure in the chain where the cluster seen is inserted,
                has a strong influence on the possibilities for industrial upgrading and the kind
                of local or global markets reached, i.e., in <i>competitive market.</i>
            </p>
            <p>The kind of local governance seeks to identity the existence of a leading
                company that conditions the strategy of the other companies in the cluster and
                the potential for joint action, i.e., affect <i>cluster collaborative environment.</i>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, the <i>cluster collective competencies</i> also has an impact on the
                competitiveness of the cluster, investigating the degree of rootedness of
                technology knowledge, and discussing the stages of technology maturity.
            </p>
            <p>Collective competence can be seen as the ability to attain competitive advantages, shared by companies included in geographically concentrated complexes, or clusters, that an isolated company could not have.

            <h3>Cluster or Industrial Districts: A Summary of the<br>
                Theoretical Discussion</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>Geographic proximity appears as an inductor of externalities (such as qualified
                    labor and access to raw materials) by agglomeration from the time of the first
                    industrial districts formed at the end of the 19th century, generating increasing
                    earnings, as suggested by Krugman (1995).
                </p>
                <p>Heizer and Render (1999) show high concentrations of a specialized labor
                    workforce such as those for cartooning in the Philippines and the perfume
                    industry in France as factors attracting global industries in these sectors to these
                    areas, generating competitive advantages.
                </p>
                <p>The literature reveals several approaches to the treatment of this theme. In this
                    project, the main conceptual focus is on issues related to the strategic impact
                    and to governance, as well as location factors and innovation inducers.
                </p>
                <p>One of the major exponents of the strategic approach to clusters is the
                    researcher Michael Porter, especially the papers of Porter (1998) and Porter
                    and Stern (2001), where the author/s discusses the strategic impact of clusters
                    on corporate competition and on countries.
                </p>
                <p>Porter (1998) dissects the anatomy of some of the main clusters in search of the
                    main players and their relationship concerning competition and cooperation.
                    According to the author, it is possible to identify a network of relations between
                    companies and other agencies related to competition, geographically concentrated and acting in a given field. This network includes suppliers specialized in
                    raw materials, equipment and services, as well as adequate infrastructure and
                    access to distribution channels and consumers. And finally, there are, in several
                    clusters, government agencies and other institutions such as universities,
                    technical training services, standards association, commercial associations,
                    and trade unions.

                   <p>In summary, Porter’s study (1998) presents clusters as a competitive advantage for regions, resulting from the harmony between competition and cooperation, enabling the use of local competencies. Three aspects related with the
                    forming of clusters are stressed by the author in leveraging competitiveness: the
                    impact on productivity and scale, on innovation, and in forming new business.
                    These impacts generated by the forming of clusters are capable of changing the
                    composition of the five forces of competition in relation to the structural analysis
                    of the industry (Porter, 1979).
                </p>
                <p>The existing literature on the impact of industrial clusters on regional development is extensive, encompassing the industrial districts in Italy and in other
                    countries and its impact on economic growth, which is mostly attributed to the
                    effectiveness of small and midsized enterprises (SME) networks, as well as to
                    local level cooperation achieved in the industrial districts of that country and to
                    their inclusion in global chains (Scott & Storper, 1988; Porter, 1998; Porter &
                    Stern, 2001; Ghemawat, 2001).
                </p>
                <p>Schmitz (1992) reports on a flexible specialization, based on a division and
                    organization of production where SMC divided the different production phases
                    of a single product among themselves. The creation of this form would be based
                    on the following features: (a) geographic concentration of companies acting in
                    the same industrial sector; (b) presence of companies of different sizes but with
                    more participation of SMC; (c) production specialization between different
                    companies on the vertical division level, involving producers and suppliers of
                    all kinds of products and services and technological support; (d) large quantity
                    and flexible variety; (e) different companies share horizontal-level production,
                    by outsourcing and complementarities; (f) the most successful complexes
                    compete on other dimensions besides price; (g) ease of entry for new
                    companies; (h) access to information and service networks (Ruas et al., 1994).
                </p>
                <p>Courlet (1993) argues that the industrial location of a small company is done
                    following a different rationale from the large corporations, and proposed the
                    study of their location according to the<i> local industrial systems.</i> These
                    systems can be seen as companies concentrated around one or several
                    industrial sectors, interacting among them and with the socio-cultural environment, generating productive externalities for all the companies. Thus, these
                    systems’ focus is not exclusively economics, but also historic, cultural, and
                    social.
                </p>
                <p>This author stresses, as location factors, the totality of technical capabilities and
                    the preexisting industrial sectors, the population’s cultural identity and habits,
                    quality of life, education, low crime rates, and good elementary and technical
                    schools, that complete the framework for attracting investments and growth for
                    these systems.
                </p>
                <p>The large corporation is usually present in technology transfer, in managerial
                    assistance, in training businesspeople and workers and especially in coordinating the production and distribution system, which encompasses a park of small
                    companies. This kind of configuration, with a large corporation organizing a
                    network of smaller companies, can be found in areas of the Silicon Valley inCalifornia and along route 128 in Massachusetts. A similar situation can also be
                    found in the industrial organization of the Emilia Romagna area, in Italy.
                </p>
                <p>On the other hand, a large corporation or a lead company can bring a strong
                    asymmetry to local companies, as shown by Belussi (1999) in his analysis of the
                    Italian industrial districts. This author found that asymmetric relations between
                    the companies located on the Italian districts have been increasing, forming
                    strongly hierarchic governance structures headed by the large corporations.
                </p>
                <p>However, it is noteworthy that the trends towards specialization and innovation
                    depend on the kind of goods produced and the dynamics of the market where
                    the companies are installed. Under conditions where cost-based competition
                    strategies predominate, these features are not found, characterizing what
                    Segenberger and Pyke (1990) called <i>low-road</i> strategies.

                <h3>Governance Analysis: Global and Local
                </h3>
                <hr>
                <p>The concept of governance was discussed by Williamson (1985), and later
                    developed by Hollingsworth and Lindberg (1986), Jessop (1998), Humphrey
                    and Schmitz (2000), and others, to address the process of coordinating the
                    economic players at the public and private, local, and global levels.
                </p>
                <p>Fleury and Fleury (2000) stress that the main idea of production-chain analysis
                    is the identification of power structures or governance, where one or more
                    corporations coordinate and control geographically separate economic activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Humphrey and Schmitz (2000, 2001) compiled literature on governance and
distinguished four kinds of governance: arm’s-length market relationships,
networks, quasi-hierarchy, and hierarchy. For these authors, there are intermediate governance structures, where both market-relations as well as hierarchies
yield to horizontal structures between the involved parties, resulting in more
frequent interactions, with a higher degree of collaboration and cooperation
among the companies. It should be stressed, however, that intermediate
structures do not necessarily mean an absence of asymmetries.
                </p>
                <p>The relevance of considering different kinds of governance is in the fact that the
                    differences in the coordination patterns of the players has direct influence on
                    their ability of upgrading possibilities of the actors along the chain, and could
                    also have a bearing on their response to fast changes in today’s context.
                    Governance structures characterized by strong hierarchies, evolving from the
                </p>
                <i>Table 3.3. Forms of joint action in clusters (adapted from Schmitz, 1997)</i>

                <p>unequal bargaining power held by the companies involved in the process,
                    represent the greatest threats to the power connections.
                </p>
                <p>For the corporation, identifying the kind of governance held by the chain’s
                    players enables it to avoid such threats, by planning neutralizing strategies,
                    turning the tables, and creating opportunities by means of alliances, partnerships, and networks.
                </p>
                <p>Another relevant component in this analysis is local governance, which has an
                    important role in coordinating joint actions among a cluster’s companies. This
                    local-level governance does not necessarily replicate the global value chain
                    relations, since very often this locality represents only one link in a large global
                    chain. Schmitz (1997) distinguishs between horizontal cooperation and vertical
                    cooperation, as well as bilateral and multilateral, as shown in Table 3.3.
                </p>
                <p>The main players in this kind of governance are local development agencies and
                    trade associations, who catalyze joint actions of local enterprises, promoting local
                    development and the dynamism of this group of companies. On the other hand, the
                    lead firm’s role in conditioning the cluster’s dynamics is also an important issue to
                    be stressed, since the other companies also benefit from the leader’s development,
                    even if unbalanced.
                </p>
                <p>There are also forms of public local governance that can be coordinated by
                    local government, through the establishment and maintenance of institutions
                    which support local companies, such as training centers, technology services
                    suppliers, and governmental development agencies, among others. According
                    to Porter (1998), clusters enable a new kind of dialogue between the private
                    and public sectors. Government, in its various spheres, should provide educated citizens and high-quality infrastructure. But in this context, there is an
                    important government role: the legislature, both in terms of the rules of
                    competition (laws protecting intellectual property, antitrust, etc.), and to the
                    definition of an industrial policy, which fosters the creation, and growth of
                    clusters (tax reductions, etc.). It is important to stress the role of funding by
                    agencies and banks.

                <center><h3>Decision-Making Tool Applied to
                    Environment Analysis</h3></center>
                    <hr>
                <p>Besides the environment analysis presented in this chapter, there are several
                    decision-making tools that could help the strategist to make a good map.
                </p>
                <p>The Rivalry Matrix, proposed by Furrer and Thomas (2000), is a focusing tool
                    for several analysis models of the competitive environment. Its function is to
                    shown the analyst which is the best model to use in a given market situation. It
                    presupposes that each of the existing models is only effective when applied in
                    a more specific situation, and that the combined use of four models can
                    encompass most of the possible situations.
                </p>
                <p>The Rivalry Matrix includes the two following dimensions, which are used to
                    classify the market under study and to recommend which model should be used:
                <i>the number of decision variables and the nature of the environment</i>
                    (Figure 3.5).
                </p>
                <p>According to Furrer and Thomas (2000), the <i>number of decision variables</i>
                    is related to the complexity of the problem under analysis. In more focused
                    cases, such as the launching of a new product, all external variables are taken
                    as constants, while in more complex cases, when the company must decide
                    between several alternatives, the number of variables increases. A typical
                    example of a case with several variables, presented by the authors, is when a
                </p>
                <i>Figure 3.5. Rivalry matrix (adapted from Furrer & Thomas, 2000)</i>
                <center><img  src="C:\Users\user\Documents\Lightshot\Screenshot_38.png"></center>
                <p>company tries to fight a competitor’s price reduction, and has several different
                    strategies, such as to reduce price, launch a new product, improve its own
                    product, enter a new market, or any combination of these alternatives. The
                    authors state that as the problem becomes more complex, and the number of
                    variables increases, the more difficult it becomes to model the situation and the
                    player’s competitive movements.
                </p>
                <p>Another dimension used in the Rivalry matrix is the<i> nature of the environment.</i>
                    In order to be able to tell which environment is foreseeable or not, it is important
                    to study the market and its evolution. In predictable environments, market
                    variations are very small, or show a constant and organic evolution. On the
                    other hand, turbulent and unpredictable markets are historically characterized
                    by creation of new substitute technologies or by the entrance of a new
                    competitor coming from a totally different industry, causing unbalance and
                    leading to sudden changes in the player’s movements (Furred & Thomas,
                    2000).
                </p>
                <p>The combination of the two dimensions — <i>the number of decision variables</i>
                    and <i>nature of the environment</i> — comprise the four quadrants of the Rivalry
                    matrix (see Figure 3.5). The analyst must classify the market under study on one
                    of the two quadrants, selecting the best model for his study.
                </p>
                <p>
                The models analyzed and classified by Furrer and Thomas (2000) according
to the main authors in the rivalry matrix are the following:
</p>
<p><b>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Game Theory Modeling</b> (e.g., Camerer, 1991; Oster,1999)
</p>
<p><b>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scenarios, Simulations, and System Dynamic Modeling </b>(e.g., Porter& Spence, 1982; Mezias & Eisner,1997)
</p>
<p><b>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Warfare and multipoint competition</b> (e.g., Karnani & Wernerfet,
    1985; Chen,1996; DÁveni, 1994)
</p>
<p><b>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frameworks</b>(e.g., Porter, 1980, 1991)

</p>
<p>The <i>frameworks</i> were presented in Chapters II and III, and the others models
    will be discussed in the second part of this book.</p>
